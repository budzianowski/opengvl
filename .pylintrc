# Additional non-critical messages often noisy in tests, examples, and adapters
# - invalid-name: allow test/helper names that don't follow strict style
# - too-few-public-methods: small data-holder classes
# - no-self-use: methods used by tests but not using self
# - redefined-outer-name: common in test fixtures
# - too-many-arguments / too-many-locals: tests and helpers can be verbose
# - too-many-instance-attributes: simple structs in tests may have many attrs
# - duplicate-code: test data scaffolding can repeat patterns
# - import-error: optional dependencies or env-specific imports in dev
