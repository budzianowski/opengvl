@dataclass
class Episode:
    """
    Container for a single episode (or a selected subsequence of it) used in
    evaluation/training.

    Attributes
    - instruction: Natural-language description of the task to complete.
    - starting_frame: The first observation of the (sub)episode.
    - episode_index: Index of this episode within the source dataset.
    - original_frames_indices: Sorted indices from the original episode that
        define the selected subsequence.
    - original_frames_task_completion_rates: Per-frame task completion rates for
        the frames referenced by ``original_frames_indices`` (1:1 aligned; i-th
        value corresponds to the i-th index above).
    - shuffled_frames_indices: Indices from the original episode corresponding to
        ``shuffled_frames``, ordered as they are fed to the model (shuffled order).
        Each entry should also exist in ``original_frames_indices``.
    - shuffled_frames: Frames arranged according to ``shuffled_frames_indices``.
    - shuffled_frames_approx_completion_rates: Per-shuffled-frame approximate
        completion rates (1:1 aligned with ``shuffled_frames``).

    Invariants
    - len(original_frames_indices) == len(original_frames_task_completion_rates)
    - len(shuffled_frames_indices) == len(shuffled_frames)
        == len(shuffled_frames_approx_completion_rates)
    - All values in ``shuffled_frames_indices`` refer to frames from the same
        episode namespace as ``original_frames_indices``.
